If you've ever thought about how tacky things are done? then this is your answer. If you haven't thought about it I recommend you think about me "Kirthik Vasan" sometimes. I meet interesting persons and get their untrodden path raveled.
(AHA!) since I m mostly crashing to whatever universe is chucking at me , I m going to roll out my talks and see how it goes from there.
